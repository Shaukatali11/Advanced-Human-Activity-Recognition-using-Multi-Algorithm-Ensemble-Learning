# "SmartMotion: Advanced Human Activity Recognition using Multi-Algorithm Ensemble Learning"

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a system that can accurately recognize different human activities based on data collected from sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes. This involves processing a large dataset containing measurements of triaxial acceleration and angular velocity, along with various time and frequency domain variables derived from these measurements. The system needs to correctly classify each activity performed by the person wearing the sensors, such as walking, sitting, standing, and others.
## Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests, to develop models for accurately recognizing human activities based on sensor data. The goal is to train and evaluate each model to determine which algorithm yields the highest accuracy in classifying activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and others.
## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered sensor data from volunteers wearing smartphones equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes while performing various activities of daily living (ADL).
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data, including noise filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction to prepare it for model training.
   
3. **Model Development**: Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests.
   
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained each model on a portion of the dataset and evaluated its performance using cross-validation techniques. Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
   
5. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuned the selected model parameters and explored ensemble methods to improve classification performance further.
   
6. **Deployment**: Provided instructions for deploying the trained model in real-world applications, along with guidelines for data collection and preprocessing to ensure optimal performance.
